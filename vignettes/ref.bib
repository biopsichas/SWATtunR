abstract = {The U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Southeast Watershed Research Laboratory (SEWRL) initiated a hydrologic research program on the Little River Experimental Watershed in south-central Georgia, United States, in 1967. The primary intent of the program was to develop an improved understanding of basic hydrologic and water quality processes on Coastal Plain watersheds and to evaluate the effects of agricultural management practices on the region's natural resources and environment. Long-term (up to 37 years), research-quality streamflow data have been collected for up to eight flow measurement sites within the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic region, an important agricultural production area in the southeastern United States. Forty-six precipitation gauges and three climate stations are currently in operation to collect data in support of the hydrologic network. Over the past 20 years, sediment and agrichemical concentrations in streamflow have also been monitored to permit evaluation of the impacts of agriculture on regional surface and groundwater quality. Along with the hydrologic and water quality data, geographic spatial data layers for terrain, soils, geology, vegetation, and land management have also been developed. These databases, described in five accompanying data reports, can be accessed via an ftp site supported by the SEWRL (ftp://www.tiftonars.org/).},

abstract = {{Reliable simulations of hydrological models require that model parameters are precisely identified. In constraining model parameters to small ranges, high parameter identifiability is achieved. In this study, it is investigated how precisely model parameters can be constrained in relation to a set of contrasting performance criteria. For this, model simulations with identical parameter samplings are carried out with a hydrological model (SWAT) applied to three contrasting catchments in Germany (lowland, mid-range mountains, alpine regions). Ten performance criteria including statistical metrics and signature measures are calculated for each model simulation. Based on the parameter identifiability that is computed separately for each performance criterion, model parameters are constrained to smaller ranges individually for each catchment. An iterative repetition of model simulations with successively constrained parameter ranges leads to more precise parameter identifiability and improves model performance. Based on these results, a more consistent handling of model parameters is achieved for model calibration.}},

abstract = {{Input data collection, quality assurance and preparation are central but time\_consuming steps in environmental modeling. Errors due to manual processing of model input data can result in an incorrect representation of an environmental system and may consequently lead to implausible model simulations. Correct input data preparation and thorough quality check at an early stage of the model setup procedure are essential to build confidence in model simulation results. Typically, in environmental model applications, many steps in the input data preparation phase have to be repeated with the inflow of new, additional or corrected data. In this study, we selected the widely used SWAT + ecohydrological model as an illustrative example to investigate challenges related to input data preparation. To assist in these tasks, we developed an R package named SWATprepR, which provides functions for typical and repeating SWAT + model input data preparation tasks. The package supports the preparation of weather input files, atmospheric deposition, soil parameters, crop rotations, and observed (control or calibration) data, to name a few, presently with focus on European applications. The SWATprepR functions are integrated in R script workflows and can help SWAT + modelers to avoid repetitive tasks, secure reproducibility and transparently document the data processing steps. Application of the package is illustrated with a test case of a SWAT + model for a small catchment in central Poland.}},

abstract = {{The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is applied worldwide for modeling basin-scale processes. Its latest version (SWAT+) adds new capabilities to the tool, and collectively with increasing computational power and availability of public datasets expands model complexity as well as provides pathways for serious errors in the model setup process. These models are used to run scenarios to support decision-making processes, hence undetected faults can have a substantial socio-economic and environmental impact. We propose a 5-step SWAT+ model setup verification workflow assessing the soundness of processes related to weather, water balance, management, plant growth, point source and tile drain flows. We developed an R package, called SWATdoctR, which guides the user through the model setup verification process, allowing the identification of typical, but repeatedly overlooked, issues. The workflow and the functionality of the tool is demonstrated in 4 SWAT+ setups in different catchments, at various stages of model setup.}},
