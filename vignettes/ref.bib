abstract = {Summary
Hydrological models have to be calibrated accurately to provide reasonable model results. For a concise model evaluation, the different phases of the hydrograph have to be considered in multi-metric frameworks with appropriate performance metrics. Low and high flows need to be reproduced simultaneously without neglecting the other phases of the hydrograph. In this paper, we highlight the relevance of very low and low flows with separate performance metrics. We present a multi-metric evaluation framework to identify calibration runs, which represent the different phases of the hydrograph precisely. A stepwise evaluation was done with commonly used statistical performance metrics (Nash–Sutcliffe, percent bias) and signature metrics, which are based on the flow duration curve (FDC). In order to consider a fairly balanced evaluation between high and low flow phases, we divided the flow duration curve into segments of high, medium and low flow phases, and additionally into very high and very low flow phases. The model performance in these segments was evaluated separately with the root mean square error (RMSE). Our results show that this evaluation method leads to an improved selection of good calibration runs to enhance the overall model performance by the refined segmentation of FDC. By combining performance metrics for high flow conditions with low flow conditions, this study demonstrates the challenge of calibrating a model with a satisfactory performance in high and low phases simultaneously. Consequently, we conclude that an additional performance metric for very low flows should be included in model analyzes to improve the overall performance in all phases of the hydrograph.}

abstract = {The U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Southeast Watershed Research Laboratory (SEWRL) initiated a hydrologic research program on the Little River Experimental Watershed in south-central Georgia, United States, in 1967. The primary intent of the program was to develop an improved understanding of basic hydrologic and water quality processes on Coastal Plain watersheds and to evaluate the effects of agricultural management practices on the region's natural resources and environment. Long-term (up to 37 years), research-quality streamflow data have been collected for up to eight flow measurement sites within the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic region, an important agricultural production area in the southeastern United States. Forty-six precipitation gauges and three climate stations are currently in operation to collect data in support of the hydrologic network. Over the past 20 years, sediment and agrichemical concentrations in streamflow have also been monitored to permit evaluation of the impacts of agriculture on regional surface and groundwater quality. Along with the hydrologic and water quality data, geographic spatial data layers for terrain, soils, geology, vegetation, and land management have also been developed. These databases, described in five accompanying data reports, can be accessed via an ftp site supported by the SEWRL (ftp://www.tiftonars.org/).},

In constraining model parameters to small ranges, high parameter identifiability is achieved. In this study, it is investigated how precisely model parameters can be constrained in relation to a set of contrasting performance criteria. For this, model simulations with identical parameter samplings are carried out with a hydrological model (SWAT) applied to three contrasting catchments in Germany (lowland, mid-range mountains, alpine regions). Ten performance criteria including statistical metrics and signature measures are calculated for each model simulation. Based on the parameter identifiability that is computed separately for each performance criterion, model parameters are constrained to smaller ranges individually for each catchment. An iterative repetition of model simulations with successively constrained parameter ranges leads to more precise parameter identifiability and improves model performance. Based on these results, a more consistent handling of model parameters is achieved for model calibration.}},

abstract = {{Input data collection, quality assurance and preparation are central but time\_consuming steps in environmental modeling. Errors due to manual processing of model input data can result in an incorrect representation of an environmental system and may consequently lead to implausible model simulations. Correct input data preparation and thorough quality check at an early stage of the model setup procedure are essential to build confidence in model simulation results. Typically, in environmental model applications, many steps in the input data preparation phase have to be repeated with the inflow of new, additional or corrected data. In this study, we selected the widely used SWAT + ecohydrological model as an illustrative example to investigate challenges related to input data preparation. To assist in these tasks, we developed an R package named SWATprepR, which provides functions for typical and repeating SWAT + model input data preparation tasks. The package supports the preparation of weather input files, atmospheric deposition, soil parameters, crop rotations, and observed (control or calibration) data, to name a few, presently with focus on European applications. The SWATprepR functions are integrated in R script workflows and can help SWAT + modelers to avoid repetitive tasks, secure reproducibility and transparently document the data processing steps. Application of the package is illustrated with a test case of a SWAT + model for a small catchment in central Poland.}},

Its latest version (SWAT+) adds new capabilities to the tool, and collectively with increasing computational power and availability of public datasets expands model complexity as well as provides pathways for serious errors in the model setup process. These models are used to run scenarios to support decision-making processes, hence undetected faults can have a substantial socio-economic and environmental impact. We propose a 5-step SWAT+ model setup verification workflow assessing the soundness of processes related to weather, water balance, management, plant growth, point source and tile drain flows. We developed an R package, called SWATdoctR, which guides the user through the model setup verification process, allowing the identification of typical, but repeatedly overlooked, issues. The workflow and the functionality of the tool is demonstrated in 4 SWAT+ setups in different catchments, at various stages of model setup.}},
