# SWATtunR

The goal of `SWATtunR` is to help with the [SWAT+ model](https://swat.tamu.edu/software/plus/) calibration and validation. These functions were developed and tested for the implementation of modeling tasks in the [OPTAIN project](https://www.optain.eu/), [Nordbalt-Ecosafe](https://projects.au.dk/nordbalt-ecosafe) and [LIFE SIP Vanduo](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/life/publicWebsite/project/LIFE22-IPE-LT-LIFE-SIP-Vanduo-101104645/integrated-water-management-in-lithuania). Functions are initially developed by [Christoph Schuerz](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=49467), which added important capability on top of other R tools designed for the SWAT/SWAT+ models. Therefore, we highly recommend trying and using these tools:

- [SWATbuildR](https://git.ufz.de/optain/wp4-integrated-assessment/swat/bildr_script)^[For access please inquire at *christoph.schuerz@ufz.de*.] -
  R tool for building SWAT+ setups; 
- [SWATprepR](https://biopsichas.github.io/SWATprepR/) - SWAT+ model input data preparation helper. The package is presented in the article @plunge2024b;
- [SWATfarmR](http://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATfarmR/) - R tool for
  preparing management schedules for SWAT model;
- [SWATdoctR](https://git.ufz.de/schuerz/swatdoctr) - A collection of
  functions in R and routines for SWAT model calibration and model
  diagnostics. The package is presented in the article @plunge2024a;
- [SWATrunR](https://chrisschuerz.github.io/SWATrunR/) - R tool for running 
SWAT models for different parameters and scenarios. Please install branch names *remove_legacy*. It could be done using line like this `remotes::install_github("chrisschuerz/SWATrunR@remove_legacy")`
- [SWATmeasR](https://nc.ufz.de/s/KA9Cr2bbtALGMHr?path=%2FWPs%20%26%20Tasks%2FWP4%2FTask%204.4%2FTools%20to%20share)^[For access please inquire at *christoph.schuerz@ufz.de*.] - R tool for implementing Natural/Small Water Retention Measures (NSWRMs) in the SWAT+ models and running scenarios.

Detailed information about packages, workflow steps, input data, SWAT+ parameters, model calibration, validation, etc., could be found in the [SWAT+ modeling protocol](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7463395) @optain2022.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **SWATtunR** from [GitHub](https://github.com/biopsichas/SWATtunR).

``` r
# If the package 'remotes' is not installed run first:
install.packages("remotes")

# The installation of `SWATprepR`.
remotes::install_github("biopsichas/SWATtunR")
```
