Description: SWATtunR provides a comprehensive set of functions for soft and hard model calibration, validation steps, calculating performance metrics, plotting model output for user decision-making, and updating parameters in the model file. The scripted workflow and functionality of SWATtunR offer a guideline for in-depth model calibration and validation, ultimately enhancing the quality of model calibration and increasing reproducibility, transparency, and automation in the SWAT+ model setup process. SWATtunR adheres to the same data structure principles as other existing R packages in the SWAT-R modeling universe and can therefore be easily integrated with other SWAT R packages, such as SWATprepR, SWATbuildR, SWATdoctR, SWATrunR, and SWATmeasR.
