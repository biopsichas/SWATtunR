\title{Plot Flow Duration Curve (FDC) for Observed and Simulated Data}
\usage{
plot_fdc(
  sim,
  obs,
  run_ids = NULL,
  scale_log = TRUE,
  x_label = "Exceedance Probability (\%)",
  y_label = "Discharge (log scale)",
  title = "Flow Duration Curve: Observed vs Simulated"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{A data frame or matrix of simulated discharge time series.
Columns are assumed to represent different simulation runs, and one column
should be named "date" for the date/time information.
If only one simulation is provided, it will be plotted as a single line.}

\item{obs}{A data frame with two columns: "date" and "discharge", where "date"
contains the date/time information and "discharge" contains the observed discharge values.}

\item{run_ids}{Optional. A character, numeric or a vector of character strings
specifying which simulation run IDs to include (e.g., \code{c("0001", "0002")}).
Matching is done by name, so exact character matching is recommended.}

\item{scale_log}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), a log-10 transformation
is applied to the y-axis.}

\item{x_label}{Label for the x-axis. Defaults to "Exceedance Probability (\%)".}

\item{y_label}{Label for the y-axis. Defaults to "Discharge (log scale)".}

\item{title}{Plot title. Defaults to "Flow Duration Curve: Observed vs Simulated".}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the flow duration curve with observed and simulated data.
}
\description{
This function computes and plots the Flow Duration Curve (FDC) for observed
and simulated discharge data.
If multiple simulations are provided, a shaded band (minâ€“max) and median line are shown.
If only one simulation is provided, a single line is plotted.
